### Week 13 Homework
#### About This Homework

This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users stored in a database. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
<br />

#### How it Works

Express is used in this app to handle api routing. It uses API get requests to get the url and then post the results in json format. The information collected from the user via survey, is then compared the users answers against a database of other users, and uses the difference to compare and find a Best Match. The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
